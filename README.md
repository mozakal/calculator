# Calculator

This project is a simple web-based calculator demonstrating basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated my ability to:
- Set up a GitHub repository and use Git for version control.
- Create an HTML structure for a web page.
- Style the web page using CSS.
- Use JavaScript to dynamically manipulate the DOM and implement calculator functionality.

## Features
- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Clear functionality to reset the calculator.
- Error handling for division by zero.
